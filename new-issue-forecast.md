## 🎯 Summary
Add a 5-day weather forecast display that shows future weather conditions below the current weather information, providing users with extended weather planning capabilities.

## 📋 Problem Description
Currently, the Weather App only shows current weather conditions. Users often need to plan for upcoming days and would benefit from seeing weather forecasts for the next 5 days. This is a standard feature in most weather applications and would significantly enhance the app's utility.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Implement a horizontal scrollable forecast section that displays:
- Daily weather icons and conditions
- High/low temperatures for each day
- Day of the week labels
- Brief weather descriptions
- Smooth transitions and responsive design

## 🔧 Implementation Details
### Components to modify:
- [ ] `WeatherService.js` - Add forecast API endpoints
- [ ] `WeatherCard.jsx` - Include forecast section
- [ ] `App.jsx` - Handle forecast state management

### New files needed:
- [ ] `components/ForecastCard.jsx` - Individual day forecast component
- [ ] `components/ForecastCard.css` - Forecast styling
- [ ] `components/ForecastSection.jsx` - Container for all forecast cards

### Technical Requirements:
- Use OpenWeatherMap 5-day forecast API endpoint
- Implement horizontal scrolling for mobile responsiveness
- Cache forecast data to reduce API calls
- Handle loading states and error scenarios
- Maintain current glassmorphism design aesthetic

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations
- **Layout:** Horizontal card layout below current weather
- **Design:** Consistent with current glassmorphism theme
- **Mobile:** Swipeable horizontal scroll on small screens
- **Desktop:** All 5 days visible in a row
- **Animation:** Smooth fade-in when data loads
- **Icons:** Weather icons matching current design
- **Typography:** Clear day labels and temperature displays

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Display 5-day forecast below current weather
- [ ] Show day of week, weather icon, high/low temps for each day
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Smooth loading animations and error handling
- [ ] Forecast updates when user searches new location
- [ ] Forecast updates when user uses location detection
- [ ] Maintains current app's visual design language
- [ ] Performance: Forecast loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## 📊 Priority
**High** - This is a core weather app feature that users expect

## 📝 Additional Context
### API Integration:
- OpenWeatherMap provides 5-day forecast with 3-hour intervals
- We'll need to process this data to show daily summaries
- Current API key can be used (when real API is enabled)

### Design Inspiration:
- Modern weather apps like Weather.com, AccuWeather
- Keep consistent with our current glassmorphism design
- Consider dark theme compatibility for future

### Sample API Response Structure:
```json
{
  "list": [
    {
      "dt": 1574346000,
      "main": {"temp_max": 285.5, "temp_min": 282.1},
      "weather": [{"main": "Clear", "icon": "01d"}],
      "dt_txt": "2024-05-30 12:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

This feature will significantly improve the app's functionality and user value! 🌤️
