**Issue:** Add a button to detect current location  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Branch:** `feature/location-detection` → merged to `main`  
**Commit:** `63eda23`

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Location Detection Button**
- Added "📍 My Location" button next to search bar
- Modern glassmorphism design matching the app's aesthetic
- Loading states with "Detecting..." feedback
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. **Geolocation API Integration**
- Browser's `navigator.geolocation` API implementation
- Proper error handling for all geolocation scenarios:
  - Permission denied
  - Location unavailable
  - Timeout errors
  - Browser compatibility issues

### 3. **Weather Service Enhancement**
- `getCurrentLocationWeather()` method for location detection
- `getWeatherByCoordinates(lat, lon)` for coordinate-based weather
- Mock data implementation with coordinate matching
- Ready for real API integration when needed

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**
- Smooth loading states and transitions
- Clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- Non-blocking UI (other functionality remains available)
- Tooltips and accessibility features
